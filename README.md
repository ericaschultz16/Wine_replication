# Wine_replication
This repo is to showcase the replication project I did while earning my master's degree at the University of Pittsburgh. The original paper is "Do Expert Reviews Affect the Demand for Wine?" by Richard Friberg and Erik Gr√∂nqvist and can be found here :https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.4.1.193. The authors have published their Stata .do files and their data set here: https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/113808/version/V1/view.
